# Pomodoro

A Pomodoro app that helps you focus.

The app lets you start a Pomodoro timer, switch between focus and break modes, pause the timer whenever you need, as well as add tasks you're currently working on. The app sends notifications with a random motivational message to your phone whenever it is time to switch to focus/break mode. You can also play ambient rain or fire sounds to help you focus while you work. 

# Running

In order to run the app, do

`flutter run`

or, if you're using Firebase Studio, do 

`flutter run -d web-server`
